# Dashboard
The home control dashboard I run on a Raspberry Pi (Google Traffic, Current Weather, Hue Light Control, Window Shade Control, Sonos Control).

# Sun Shades
Automatic sun shade control using a Somfy RF board connected to an Arduino+Ethernet Shield. Includes an Android app for shade control (customized for my place, ymmv).
